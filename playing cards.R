#This project will teach me how to store, retrieve, 
# and change data values in my computerâ€™s memory

# BUILD THE DECK
# matrix will fill up the matrix column by column by default, 
# but you can fill the matrix row by row if you include the argument byrow = TRUE:

die <- 1:6
matrix(die,nrow = 2,byrow = T)
# Arrays
# array is not as customizeable as matrix and 
# basically does the same thing as setting the dim attribute
# To use array, provide an atomic vector as the first argument,
# and a vector of dimensions as the second argument, now called dim:
# 

# Write functions that deal and shuffle
# Change the point system to suit your game
# Manage the state of the deck
